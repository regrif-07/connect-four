# Specification
Write a program that implements a computer version of the connect four
(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four) game. The game is played on a board that is 7
fields wide and 6 fields high. It is played by two players with the symbols ‘X’ and ‘O’. Players
can choose the column in which their symbol is placed on top of the symbols that are already in
that column. The winner is the player that first makes a row of 4 symbols either vertically,
horizontally or diagonally. The goal is to write a program that implements this game. When
started the program should display main menu with the following three options:
1) Play a new game
2) Load already saved game
3) Exit the game

If option **1) Play a new game** is chosen, the program should allow players to enter their names.
First the ’X’ player should make its move by entering an integer number from 1 to 7 which
indicates the row in which he would like to place his symbol. After this, the program should
switch the player turns and allow each player to enter its sign to the board. After each turn,
program should print out the state of the board. Game ends either if one of the players connects 4
symbols in a column or if the whole board is filled with signs and no one won. Program should
check these ending conditions after each turn and properly inform the players if the game has
ended and who won. If someone wins, program should print out the board with the higlighted
connected symbols that caused the victory. This could be done by printing the board with ’Y’
symbols on the places of the connected symbols. After the game has ended, players should be
asked if they would like to start a new game or go back to the main menu. If during the play a
player selects a row that is already filled with symbols, program should inform him that such a
move is not allowed and ask him to select some other row. If at any point one of the players
enters 0 instead of an integer 1 to 7, program should save the current game. Game is saved by
saving the current state of the board and the player names. Each new saved game should have a
unique ID of the saved game. After saving the game, program should inform the players that
their game has been saved and print the ID of the saved game, after this the game play should
continue in the described way without further interruption. After saving the game result should
be saved inside the file result.txt.

If option **2) Load already saved game** is chosen, a new menu opens with the following options:
1) List all saved games
2) List all saved games for a particular player
3) Show the board of one of the saved games
4) Load a game
5) Return to main menu

If **1) List all saved games** is selected, program should list all the games that are saved in the
file. Games should be listed is the following format:
ID, ’X’ player name, ’O’ player name, number of free fields left on the board
Each saved game should be printed in a new line
If **2) List all saved games for a particular player** is selected, program should ask the user to
enter a name and then it should list all the saved games that have that name as one of the players
in the same format as specified above.
If **3) Show the board of one of the saved games** is selected, program should ask the user to
enter an ID of a saved game and then print out the player names and the board for that game.
If 4) **Load a game** is selected, program should ask the user to enter an ID of the saved game and
then start the game from the saved point. From this point on, the program should behave in the
same way as when a new game is played. Once a loaded game has finished, program should
allow the players to either start a new game (with empty board) or to return to main menu – i.e.
the same choices that they have when they play a game from an empty board.
If in options **3)** and **4)** user selects a non-existing ID, program should inform him about this and
ask him to enter a valid ID.
